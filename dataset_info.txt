# Rough explanation (not guaranteed to be correct)
Resting-state fMRI measures spontaneous brain activity when the subject is not performing any specific task, typically lying still with eyes open or closed.
Multi-band imaging reduces the repetition time (TR) in fMRI by allowing multiple slices to be acquired simultaneously, enabling higher temporal resolution.
rsfMRI refers to fMRI data collected during the resting state, while fcMRI refers to the same type of data labeled with the intent of performing functional connectivity analysis.
The underlying data may be identical, with the difference only in naming conventions.
If the metadata (e.g., TR, number of slices, scan duration) is the same between the two folders, they likely represent the same scan.
Extended_Resting_State_fMRI refers to a longer-duration resting-state fMRI scan, typically acquired to enhance the reliability of functional connectivity analysis and allow for richer temporal information.
Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI) is an MRI technique used to measure cerebral blood flow, often through methods like ASL or DSC.
While both fMRI and 4D PWI data may involve similar preprocessing steps like motion correction and normalization, their processing pipelines diverge significantly due to their different goals.
relCBF stands for Relative Cerebral Blood Flow. It represents a normalized perfusion map derived from perfusion-weighted imaging (typically ASL).
